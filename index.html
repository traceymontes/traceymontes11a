    <p style="font-size:160%; font-family: monospace"> I am Tracey Nicole C. Montes from Grade 11 ICT-A. </p> 
    <p style="font-size:160%; font-family: monospace"> I was born on the 25th of May, the year 2007. I am 16 years old. </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; font-family: monospace"> I was born and raised here in Bacoor, Cavite. </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%; font-family: monospace"> I am the youngest in my family. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; font-size:300%; background-color:rgb(248, 197, 246);  font-family: monospace"> A breakthrough </h3>
    <p style="font-size:160%; font-family: monospace">I am Tracey Nicole Canon Montes. I am the youngest in my family. I have 2 siblings, a sister and a brother. Growing up,
    <br>I think it's safe to say that I had a normal, chill childhood. I liked adventures ever since I was really young. I remember hanging out
    <br> with my cousins and we would inspect our backyard that was full of plants, and we would find snails, earthworms, and the like
    <br>Other than that, I really loved staying indoors as well. Until now, actually. I love the feeling of peace and quiet whenever i'm on my own.
    <br>Personally, I really recommend having a me-time at least once a week. We all deserve that. Imagine having a ...
    <br>really bad, tough, so full of chaos week. A good ice cream date with yourself is more than enough to gain that social battery that ran out. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center; font-size:300%; background-color:rgb(248, 197, 246); font-family: monospace"> My interests! </h3>

        <br> My family always reminds me to enjoy being young, but always look out and take care of myself. I am the youngest, and a girl, so I understand that there may be times where they can 
        <br> get pretty strict on me. Looking at it, I love it whenever they do that. It just shows how much they love me and care about me. </p>
